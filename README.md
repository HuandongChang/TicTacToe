## Introduction
TicTacToe is for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Features
- Apply Java JFram and Java Swing to create User Interface

- Use Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) Random Number Generator to influence the move of machine
